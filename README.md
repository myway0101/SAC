# SAC
Implementation of Sparse Approximation based Classification for Epileptic Seizure Detection

I have uploaded all dataset and L1 minimization functions to run the main code (SAC.m).

Make sure the data folders are in the same path 

SAC.m : main code for results in Table 1  
       
       for Table 2, please change time_samples (line 22 in SAC.m) to 2048 for 1/2 samples, 1024 for 1/4 samples
       
       for Table 3, please select corresponding classification dataset (line 92~95 in SAC.m)
        
SAC_multi_class.m : code for multi-class SAC used in Table 4

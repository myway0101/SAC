# SAC
Implementation of Sparse Approximation based Classification for Epileptic Seizure Detection

I have uploaded all dataset and L1 minimization functions to run the main code.
Just add all path 

Before run SAC.m code, please download corresponding Epileptic seizure dataset (http://epileptologie-bonn.de/cms/front_content.php?idcat=193&lang=3) and L1 minimization toolbox (http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~yang/software/l1benchmark/).
